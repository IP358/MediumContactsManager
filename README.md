## About
This was a small project to put into practice tutorials of react and redux that I've gone through on Udemy. The styling was done for desktop-use only. 

## Description
* An ID is generated from the phone number and email address, therefore they're the only required fields for the contact.
* If changing an existing contact's email address or phone number, an option is given to either create a new contact (keeping the previous one), or change the current contact's email/ phone number.
* For ease of demostration purposes, the app does not store the contacts and has a quick 'pre-load' function to showcase contact editing functionality.

## Potential Upgrades
* When editing a contact in "show-all" mode, the view should center on the expanded form without user manually scrolling downwards/upwards.
* Implement a mobile version
